# Donderdagse Week

This project is intended to automate filling a calendar with your NS work-schedule.

Every week, on the thursday, the schedules for the upcoming week are sent to NS personnel by email in a file format that isn't recognized by any calendar software I'm aware of. Putting it all in a shared calendar manually is... not fun. That's where this project comes in.
